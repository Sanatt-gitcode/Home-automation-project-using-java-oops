# Home-automation-project-using-java-oops
A comprehensive Smart Home Automation System developed in Java using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This project demonstrates how real-world home automation scenarios can be modeled using inheritance, interfaces, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
ðŸ“Œ Features
Control and automate lights, fans, doors, air conditioners, and other appliances.

Support for scheduling, device grouping, and remote control simulation.

User authentication and role-based access (Admin/User).

Real-time monitoring (simulated via console/UI).

CLI or GUI interface for user interaction.

Modular, scalable code structure following best OOP practices.

ðŸ’¡ OOP Concepts Used
Classes & Objects: Represent devices, users, controllers, and sensors.

Inheritance: Base Device class extended by specific devices like Light, Fan, AC.

Interfaces: For defining behaviors like Switchable, Schedulable, SensorOperated.

Polymorphism: Unified device control using base references.

Encapsulation: All fields are private with accessors/mutators.

Abstraction: Abstract classes for generalized behavior.

Static Members: For utility and device count tracking.

Nested/Inner Classes: For context-specific functionalities (like Room or ScheduleManager).
